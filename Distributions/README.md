This folder contains code and other files for the ChapelCon '25 Distributions Demo/Exercise session. 
It also includes a short primer on Chapel arrays.

There are 4 demos and 4 exercises. The suggested order is as follows:
- demo1
- demo2
- exercise1
- demo3
- exercise2
- exercise3
- demo4
- exercise4

There are also some solution files for the first three exercises, and reference outputs. 
Keep in mind that these reference outputs are using 2 locales. Running with different 
numbers of locales will produce different outputs.
