# 🐾 Exercise: Cats Taking Naps (Parallel forall)

Let’s say each cat needs a nap.
We’ll track how many total cats napped and how long each one slept,
in parallel.

## Extra credit: 🚀 Promotion Challenge: Parallel Naps with Arrays

Now let’s promote the idea — instead of looping manually, make the operation implicit.

Try rewriting the above using promotion, so the entire array updates in one line.

> [!TIP]
> You may need to create an array of zeroes in order to make the the
> arguments of the promoted expression are of the same shape.
