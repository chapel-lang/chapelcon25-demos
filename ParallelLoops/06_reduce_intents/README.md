# Introduction to Reduce Intents

When a `forall` loop modifies an outer variable with `ref`, multiple tasks can race if they try to write to it at the same time.

**Reductions** solve this problem: they combine values from multiple iterations safely into a single result (e.g., sum, min, max).

## How Reduce Intents Work

1. **Task-local accumulation**: Each task gets a shadow variable, initialized to the identity of the reduction operation (0 for `+`, `-inf` for `max`).
2. **Accumulate values**: The task adds or compares values into its shadow variable.
3. **Combine results**: When tasks finish, their shadow variables are safely combined into the outer variable.
4. **Outer variable inclusion**: The initial value of the outer variable is included in the final reduction.

## üê± Cat Example: Total Name Length

```chpl
const cats = ["Amber", "Winter", "Betty", "Goldie", "Colitas", "Alfredo", "CatGPT"];
var totalLength = 0;

forall catName in cats
  with (+ reduce totalLength)
{
  totalLength reduce= catName.size; // Each task safely accumulates into its shadow
}

writeln("Total kitty energy (name lengths): ", totalLength);
// Expected: 41
```


## üê± Cat Example: Max Name Length

```chpl
const cats = ["Amber", "Winter", "Betty", "Goldie", "Colitas", "Alfredo", "CatGPT"];
var maxLength = 0;

forall catName in cats
  with (max reduce maxLength)
{
  maxLength reduce= catName.size; // Accumulate maximum per task
}

writeln("Longest cat name length: ", maxLength);
// Expected: 7
```
