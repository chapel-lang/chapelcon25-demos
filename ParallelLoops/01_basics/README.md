# üìò Loop basics in Chapel


Before our cats go parallel, we recall that Chapel supports standard `for` loops just like any other language:

```chpl
const cats = ["Winter", "Betty", "Goldie", "Colitas"]

for i in 0..3 do writeln(cats[i]);
```

The `for` loop invokes a serial iterator for the object being iterated over.

In this example, the loop iterates through the range `1..3` in order, using a serial iterator. Only one iteration runs at a time ‚Äî a single thread of control.


Chapel also supports zippered iteration:


```chpl
for (i, cat) in zip(0..3, cats) {
  writeln("Meow from cat ", i, ": ", cat);
}
```


There are also other kinds of serial loops in Chapel, like `while`, `do ... while`, etc.

## üß© From Serial to Parallel

In this tutorial, we‚Äôll focus on the parallel loop constructs in Chapel ‚Äî where multiple iterations or tasks can execute concurrently.

There are two main categories of parallel loops in Chapel:

1. Task Parallel Loops
  * These explicitly create multiple tasks that can execute concurrently.
  * The key construct here is the `coforall` loop.

2. Data Parallel Loops
  * These automatically distribute work across tasks when iterating over collections of data.
  * The main constructs here are `foreach`, `forall`, and the square bracket loop (`[]`).

In the next section, we‚Äôll explore task parallelism with `coforall`.
