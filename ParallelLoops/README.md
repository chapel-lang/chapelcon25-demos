# Chapel Parallel Loops: The Curious Cat Café 🐈☕

Welcome to the **Curious Cat Café**, where Chapel tasks are cats, arrays are bowls of tuna, and loops decide how our furry friends share the work.

This 40-minute workshop teaches Chapel's serial and parallel loop constructs through a playful, hands-on storyline. Each exercise has tiny `// TODO` edits — no heavy coding required.
